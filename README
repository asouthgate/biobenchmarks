INTRODUCTION:

These scripts and accompanying datasets are designed for benchmarking of common
bioinformatics tools, utilizing GNU-time to gather basic run statistics.
Tools: velvet, prokka, blast, muscle, hmmer, phyml, snippy, beast

USAGE:

Usage: benchmarker-runner.py [command]
commands:
        run n        - runs benchmarks, where optional n specifies the number of runs to perform, with n-1 restarts in between
        output       - outputs data to output/
        graph_data   - graphs raw data to output/graphs
        graph_scores - graphs scores to output/graphs
        devWipe      - wipes all collected data, scores, and temp files"
